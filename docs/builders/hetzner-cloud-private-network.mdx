## How to use the Private Network

This chart breaks down what Packer does if you set private network options:

### Summary

To use the Private Network specify the Network name or ID.  

To connect to the Private Network set connect_with_private_ip to true.  

If you don't specify the `ip_address` the IP Assignment is the first available IP Address within the Network, if you just set the network without the subnet, the subnet gets choosen randomly.  

The subnet identificator is the IPRange and needs to be set as CIDR Format "10.1.1.0/24".

### Example

Attach to a Network named "devnet" - Random IP Assignment - connect to Private IP:

```hcl
source "hcloud" "debian" {
  image        = "debian-11"
  location     = "nbg1"
  server_type  = "cx11"
  snapshot_name = "packer-${local.timestamp}"
  snapshot_labels = {
    name        = "packer",
    environment = "devnet"
  }
  token = "${var.hcloud_token}"
  ssh_username = "root"
  network = "devnet"
  connect_with_private_ip = true
}

build {
  source "source.hcloud.debian" {

  }
}
```


Attach to a Network ID called "1234567" with the subnet "10.1.1.0/24" - Random IP Assignment - connect to Private IP:

```hcl
source "hcloud" "debian" {
  image        = "debian-11"
  location     = "nbg1"
  server_type  = "cx11"
  snapshot_name = "packer-${local.timestamp}"
  snapshot_labels = {
    name        = "packer",
    environment = "test-env"
  }
  token = "${var.hcloud_token}"
  ssh_username = "root"
  network = "1234567"
  connect_with_private_ip = true
  subnet = "10.1.1.0/24"
}

build {
  source "source.hcloud.debian" {

  }
}
```

Attach to a Network ID called "production" with the subnet "10.10.0.0/28" - Specific IP Assignment - connect to Private IP.
IP Adress has to be in the valid IP-Range of the subnet, assign two Alias IPs to the Instance:

```hcl
source "hcloud" "debian" {
  image        = "debian-11"
  location     = "nbg1"
  server_type  = "cx11"
  snapshot_name = "packer-${local.timestamp}"
  snapshot_labels = {
    name        = "packer",
    environment = "production"
  }
  token = "${var.hcloud_token}"
  ssh_username = "root"
  network = "production"
  connect_with_private_ip = true
  subnet = "10.10.1.0/28"
  ip_address = "10.10.1.2"
  alias_ips  = [ "10.10.1.4", "10.10.1.6" ]
  connect_with_private_ip = true
}

build {
  source "source.hcloud.debian" {

  }
}
```
